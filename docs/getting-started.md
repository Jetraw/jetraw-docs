# Getting started

This is a sample page to help you get started writing documentation in Markdown.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby and Bundler installed (for local preview)
- GitHub Pages enabled on your repository

## Local development

To run the site locally:

```bash
bundle add webrick # if using Ruby 3+
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000`.

## Next steps

- Create new pages under `docs/` with front matter
- Use `nav_order` to control sidebar order
- Update `_config.yml` for logo, external links, and more
