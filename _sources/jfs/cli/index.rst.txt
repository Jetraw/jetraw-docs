Command Line Interface
======================

``jr`` is a command line interface (CLI) to Jetraw Platform, for easy usability and adoption in current workflows, where the usage of a graphical user interface is either inconvenient or impossible.
The CLI provides typical bash-like commands for interacting with files and folders on the platform. Like the other Jetraw Platform clients, it features transparent compression and decompression for uploads and downloads.
