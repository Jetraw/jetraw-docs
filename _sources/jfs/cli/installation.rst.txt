Installation
============

CLI v0.23.0

Current version is suppoted on Windows 10 or higher, on MacOS Ventura 13 or higher and Ubuntu 22.04.

Set the python environment
--------------------------

To install the Jetraw CLI we need a clean environment and Python installed. For this, we recommend the following steps:

- Install Miniconda: This will install a base version of Python too. To achieve this please proceed as follows:

  - Download the Miniconda installer for MacOS from the `official website <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_.
  - Open the Terminal.
  - Navigate to the location where you downloaded the installer. For example, if the installer is in your Downloads folder, you can navigate there with ``cd /Downloads``.
  - Run the installer. Replace ``Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`` with the name of the file you downloaded.
  
    .. code-block:: console

        $ bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
  
- Close the Terminal and open a new Terminal window to activate the changes. Type in this command to verify the installation:  

  .. code-block:: console

        $ conda --version

- Create a new environment with the following command: 

  .. code-block:: console

        $ conda create -n jetraw-env python=3.13

- Activate the environment with this command:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ conda activate jetraw-env

Once Python and a the environment has been created and activated, the next step is to install the Jetraw CLI. To do so there are a few options that we propose in the following sections.

Install Jetraw CLI
------------------

There are two main ways to install the Jetraw CLI (explained below): 
install the wheels which have been previously downloaded or, install with ``pip`` directly from source. 
The first option is recommended for general usage. 

Install from a locally downloaded wheel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We suggest to install a locally downloaded wheel by following these steps :

- Download the wheel from `Dotphoton Website <https://www.dotphoton.com/products/jetraw-platform/downloads>`_.

- Pip install from local downloaded wheel

  .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install jr_cli --index-url https://jetraw-releases.s3.eu-central-2.amazonaws.com

NB: The Jetraw CLI will only be available in the given environment (``jetraw-env`` in the example above), the user will need to reactivate this environment everytime they open a new terminal for the ``jr`` command to work.

To check that ``jr`` is correctly installed, type in the terminal the following line to see the current installed versions:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jr --version
    > jr version 0.23.0

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing the Jetraw CLI, the user will need to authenticate to the platform. This can be done by running the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jr auth login

This will open a browser window where the user will need to login to the platform. Once the login is successful, the user can continue using ``jr``.
